ISLANDORA IP EMBARGO
==================

SUMMARY
-------

A Drupal based approach to embargoing content based on IP ranges.
This module is not integrated with the Islandora Embargo module.
This module breaks islandora_xml_site_map with its redirects. 

EMBARGO INHERITANCE
-------------------

By taking advantage of RELS-EXT, an embargo set at the collection or compound 
object level applies to its members or constituents until overridden at a lower
level. In a collection with an embargo set, setting an member object's embargo 
list to '' removes the embargo for that item by creating a local record.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Drupal cron should be configured to run once a day to clean out expired
embargoes.  While not a dependency more functionality can be found by
installing the Rules https://drupal.org/project/rules module.
